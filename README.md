4th Project for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree

===============================

## Get started
* [Play Game](https://gizmo01.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
* Use arrow to move
* Goal: reach the water! But be careful: don't get hit by the bugs!


* Read [arcade-game-diary.md](https://github.com/davide2894/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/blob/master/understanding-the-project.md)
* Use `app.js` to edit Enemy and Player classes
* File `resources.js` loads images needed for the canvas
* File `engine.js` handles the game loop

**Have fun!**
